## AutomationML Modeling
AutomationML Modeling is a suite of model-driven research tools available in the GitHub repository [https://github.com/amlModeling/](https://github.com/amlModeling/) based on the AutomationML standard. In particular, it applies Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)-based technologies to [CAEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAEX) (and then AutomationML). 
The suite currently includes the following tools:
- CAEX MDE Workbench that, in turn, consists of
-- Metamodels for CAEX version 2.15 and version 3.0.
-- A tree-based editor for creating, modifying, and inspecting CAEX 2.15 and CAEX 3.0 models.
-- A graphical editor for visualizing CAEX 3.0 Instance Hierarchies.
-- A textual editor for creating, modifying, and inspecting CAEX 2.15 Instance Hierarchies.
-- Modeling rules for the correct usage of CAEX with AutomationML.
-- Migration operations for converting CAEX 2.15 models into CAEX 3.0 models.
- UML profile for AutomationML
- Model Transformations between annotated UML/SysML Models and AutomationML models.
