# AIDOaRt_Hackaton

This GitHub acts as a sharing and storing of artefacts for the first VCE hackathon challenge.

In the VCE reference material you can find some reference files and the challenge itself.

As mentioned in the new GitHub we switched to avoid keeping any sensitive information on the website, if you have need of any of the previously provided reference material please contact Johan Bergelin at: 
johan.bergelin@mdu.se

The readme will be updated once the collaboration progresses.
