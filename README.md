# AIDOaRt VCE Use Case Demo


This repository contains the produced materials of the Hackathon challenges organized in the context of the [AIDOaRt European project](https://sites.mdu.se/aidoart). All these materials have been presented in the paper entitled **Towards Automating the Design of Cyber-Physical Systems: The Experience of Volvo Construction Equipment** submitted to The 19th European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA 2023) 

All the resources, including the tools and the article, have been realized by:

- Johan Bergelin
-  Luca Berardinelli
-  Damir Bilic
-  Hugo Bruneliere
-  Antonio Cicchetti
-  Mohammadhadi Dehghani
-  Claudio Di Sipio
-  James Miranda
-  Abbas Rahimi 
- Riccardo Rubei
