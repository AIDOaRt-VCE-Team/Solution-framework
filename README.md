# AIDOaRt VCE Use Case Demo


This repository contains the produced materials of the Hackathon challenges organized in the context of [AIDOaRt European project](https://sites.mdu.se/aidoart). All these materials have been presented in the paper entitled **Towards Automating the Design of Cyber-Physical Systems: The Experience of Volvo Construction Equipment** submitted to The 19th European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA 2023) 

All the resources, including the tools and the article, have been realized by:

- Johan Bergelin
-  Luca Berardinelli
-  Damir Bilic
-  Hugo Bruneliere
-  Antonio Cicchetti
-  Mohammadhadi Dehghani
-  Claudio Di Sipio
-  James Miranda
-  Abbas Rahimi 
- Riccardo Rubei


The proposed software archictecture is composed of the following list of tools:

### SysML modeling
- Papyrus UML: [https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/)

### AutomatioML modeling
- AutomationML Modeling - CAEX Workbench: [https://github.com/amlModeling/caex-workbench/tree/variability](https://github.com/amlModeling/caex-workbench/tree/variability) 

### UML profiles
- SysML v1.6 profile (see Papyrus UML)
- AutomationML profile (see AutomationML modeling)

### EMF views tool

### Modeling Process Mining Tool
- Modeling Process Mining Tool: [Modeling Process Mining Tool](https://github.com/lowcomote/sirius.process.mining)

### Modeling recommendations
To support modeling recommendations, we rely on an existing tool called MORGAN, a modeling recommender system based on graph kernels. The source code is avaialble [here](https://github.com/MDEGroup/MORGAN).

### Model generator tools
